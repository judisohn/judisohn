My career has been driven by a deep sense of passion and purpose. I launched my Salesforce journey in 2006 as a co-founder of Fight Colorectal Cancer, one of the leading colorectal cancer advocacy organizations in the U.S. In 2015, as the first Open Source Community Manager at Salesforce.org, I led the vision and launch of the Commons Program, which continues to make a meaningful impact. Later, I directed the Salesforce Customer Centric Engineering team for Industries Clouds. Today, I’m a Delivery Lead at [Elevation Solutions](https://elevation.solutions), a consulting firm dedicated to supporting educational institutions and nonprofit organizations.

Based in New Jersey, just outside Philadelphia, I’m proud to be a Salesforce All Star Ranger, a member of the Salesforce MVP Hall of Fame, and the holder of 16 Salesforce certifications. Outside of work, I’m an avid knitter who enjoys spending my free time at local yarn stores and fiber festivals.

### Connect
I'm always technically curious and interested in Salesforce, productivity apps, improving my knitting techniques, parenting adults through autism and mental illness, and New Jersey politics. I have a [very outdated blog here.](http://judisohn.com) I hope to get back to long-form blogging one day, but for now, the best way to connect with me and follow my somewhat random postings is through one of the social profiles listed below.
