### Hi!

Like everything else in my life, this is a work in progress...

I've been working for [Salesforce](http://salesforce.com) since 2015. I started as Open Source Community Manager at Salesforce.org and drove the creation of [Salesforce.org Commons](https://www.salesforce.org/resources/commons/). I now lead the Customer Centric Engineering (Production Support) team for Salesforce Industries which includes, but is not limited to Nonprofit and Education Cloud products. 

Salesforce has its own kind of social network on its Trailhead platform. [Here's my profile there](https://trailblazer.me/id/judisohn). If you want to reach out to me directly about generic Salesforce topics, sending me a private message there is the best way. Be prepared: If you're asking for my help to troubleshoot a technical problem, I'm going to just ask you to go to [Salesforce Help](http://help.salesforce.com) and open a support case.

I've had quite the professional journey from a degree in Graphic Design, to starting nonprofit organizations, to nonprofit technology, to Salesforce community and consulting, and finally to the Salesforce mother ship. [Here's my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/judisohn).

Most people know me for my obsession with knitting. Like seriously. I learned how to knit as a kid, got into it again in college, and then again in 2008. I complete at least 10 adult garments a year and I love traveling to yarn stores, conferences, and festivals. [Here's my Ravely profile](https://www.ravelry.com/people/judisohn). I also post knitting to my [Instagram profile](https://www.instagram.com/judisohn/) when I finish things. 

I have a Facebook and Twitter profile, but neither are publicly visible. The best place to find me on social media is [Mastodon](https://mas.to/@judisohn).
