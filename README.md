### Hi!

Like everything else in life, this is a work in progress...

- I've been working for [Salesforce](http://salesforce.com) since 2015. Salesforce has its own kind of social network on its Trailhead platform. [Here's my profile there](https://trailblazer.me/id/judisohn). If you want to ask me Salesforce questions, sending me a private message there is the best way. Be prepared. If you're asking for my help to troubleshoot a technical problem, I'm going to ask you to go to [Salesforce Help](http://help.salesforce.com) and open a support case.
- I've had quite the professional journey from a degree in Graphic Design, to starting nonprofit organizations, to nonprofit technology, and finally to Salesforce. [Here's my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/judisohn).
- Most people know me for my obsession with knitting. Like seriously. I learned how to knit as a kid, got into it again in college, and then again in 2008. I complete at least 10 adult garments a year and I love traveling to yarn stores, conferences, and festivals. [Here's my Ravely profile](https://www.ravelry.com/people/judisohn). I also post knitting to my [Instagram profile](https://www.instagram.com/judisohn/) when I finish things. 
- I have a Facebook and Twitter profile, but neither are publicly visible. The best place to find me on social media is [Mastodon](https://mas.to/@judisohn)

Nyla, our Coton de Tulear rescue we adopted in September 2022, says hi too...
