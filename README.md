### Hi!

Like everything else in my life, this is a work in progress...

I've had quite the professional journey from a degree in Graphic Design, to starting nonprofit organizations, to nonprofit technology, to Salesforce community and consulting, and finally to the Salesforce mother ship. I am currently open for new opportunity. [Here's my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/judisohn).

Most people know me for my obsession with knitting. Like seriously. I learned how to knit as a kid, got into it again in college, and then again in 2008. I complete at least 10 adult garments a year and I love traveling to yarn stores, conferences, and festivals. [Here's my Ravely profile](https://www.ravelry.com/people/judisohn). I also post knitting to my [Instagram profile](https://www.instagram.com/judisohn/) when I finish things. 

I have a Facebook and Twitter profile, but neither are publicly visible. The best place to find me on social media is [Mastodon](https://mas.to/@judisohn).
