### Hi!

I'm an authentic, results-oriented community builder. I've spent the last 20 years of my career focused on building community and demonstrating courageous advocacy to solve problems at scale. I am known for my empathy, technical curiosity, and get-it-done-together leadership style.  

I've had quite the professional journey from a degree in Graphic Design, to starting nonprofit organizations, to nonprofit technology, to Salesforce open source community and serving organizations in the social impact sector, and finally to the Salesforce mother ship. 

I am currently open for new opportunity. [Here's my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/judisohn).

The best place to find me on social media is [Mastodon](https://mas.to/@judisohn).
